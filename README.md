# Recipe

You might not have realized this, but recipe's are nothing more than culinary
algorithms. Like programs, recipes are a series of imperative steps which,
if followed correctly, result in a tasty dish.

The objective of the Recipe app is to help the user manage recipes in a way
that will make them easy to follow.
